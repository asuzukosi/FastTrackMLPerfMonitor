## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To install FastTrack ML Performance Tracker, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install fasttrack-ml-performance-tracker
```

## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before you start using FastTrack ML Performance Tracker, make sure you have a Python environment set up.

1. Import the package into your Python script:

```python
from fasttrack_ml_tracker import FastTrackTracker
```

2. Create an instance of the tracker:

```python
tracker = FastTrackTracker()
```

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Tracking Experiments <a name="tracking-experiments"></a>

FastTrack ML Performance Tracker allows you to easily track and manage machine learning experiments. Here's how to use it:

1. Start a new experiment:

```python
tracker.start_experiment(experiment_name="My First Experiment")
```

2. Within the experiment, record metrics, parameters, and artifacts:

```python
tracker.log_metric("accuracy", 0.92)
tracker.log_param("learning_rate", 0.001)
tracker.log_artifact("model.pkl", "path/to/your/model.pkl")
```

3. End the experiment when it's finished:

```python
tracker.end_experiment()
```

### Comparing with MLflow <a name="comparing-with-mlflow"></a>

FastTrack ML Performance Tracker is designed to provide features similar to MLflow. You can compare the two as follows:
